# Crunchyget

Crunchyget is a script that allows you to easily download videos from
Crunchyroll. It uses [youtube-dl][1] to download the videos, and can
automatically rename them and convert them to MP4 format using [ffmpeg][2]. It
can download and convert multiple videos at the same time to the same directory,
without facing any problems due to multiple instances.

Dependencies: [youtube-dl][1], [ffmpeg][2], [perl-rename][3]
